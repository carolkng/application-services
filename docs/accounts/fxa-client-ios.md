The **Firefox Accounts iOS SDK** provides a way for iOS applications to do the following:

* Fetch scoped keys to provide a key for end-to-end encryption.
* Get access to Firefox Sync keys to fetch the sync data.
* Fetch user's profile to personalize the applications.

Please see the [FxA iOS SDK documentation](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/tree/master/fxa-rust-client/sdks/swift/FxAClient)
to integrate this component into your application.
