Welcome to the developer home of Firefox Sync. For end-user
(non-technical) information, please see [the official Sync web
site](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/sync/).

Firefox Sync is a set of software components and specifications that
synchronize data between multiple Mozilla product instances. The
software is open source and the specifications are all public. This
means that others are free to implement components or run the software
on their own.

### Products and Services

The Sync family consists of the following products and services:

* Client: Integrated in Firefox Desktop, Firefox for Android, and Firefox for iOS
* [Server](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Sync/Server): Server component used for cross-client communication
* Server Instance: A Sync server operated by Mozilla available for use by anybody in the world, free of charge. This is where Firefox sends data by default, unless you specify a different server.

### Specifications

The [storage server documentation](https://mozilla-services.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) covers the Sync HTTP server API, cryptography model, daa storage formats, and how to run your own Sync server stack.
